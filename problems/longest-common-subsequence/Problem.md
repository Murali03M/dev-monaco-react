## Longest Common Subsequence

The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is a classic problem in computer science where the goal is to find the length of the longest subsequence that is common to two sequences (strings). A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily consecutively.

### Problem Statement

Write a function that takes two strings and returns the length of the longest subsequence that is common to both strings.

#### Input
- Two strings.

#### Output
- An integer representing the length of the longest common subsequence.


#### Test case 1

Input

```
abcde, ace

```

Output

```
3

```

#### Test case 2

Input

```
abc, abc

```

Output

```
3

```
